Client Convenience, Communication, Education, and Satisfaction 

## General
The purpose of this repository is to ensure client satisfaction. The attacks performed during the tests can be forked from here (with the original source of the fork stated and implied). 

#### Tools are open-source and intended for ethical penetration testing.

## Attack Folder
This folder includes the tools used during penetration testing, in addition to the industry standards typically expected. We believe in both automating and manually performing tests to ensure that all avenues are considered for client satisfaction and security confirmation.
